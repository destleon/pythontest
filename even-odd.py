# If you give 2 cookies to each friend, you'll have 0 cookies left because 10 divided by 2 is 5 with no remainder. You can say that 10 % 2 equals 0.


# Now, let's say you have 11 cookies and you want to share them among your friends, again giving 2 cookies to each friend. 
# This time, you can give 2 cookies to the first 5 friends, which is 10 cookies, but you'll have 1 cookie left. So, 11 divided by 2 is 5 with a remainder of 1. 
# You can say that 11 % 2 equals 1.
